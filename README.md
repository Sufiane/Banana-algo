# Banana-algo

Transform a string of characters "SUFIANE" into a string of characters of the same size with a single unique character.
example: SSSSSSS.

The objective is to know how to do it as quickly as possible.
You can only change a consonant to a vowel and vice versa.
The modification can only occur every second.

examples:

- BANANA -> AAAAAA: 3s
- FBHC: fastest result 4s
- FOXEN: fastest 5s

The format of the result should be the following:
StringToConvert â†’ ConvertedString: time s

PS: we will consider that a change takes one second, there is no need to wait a real second to make the change.
